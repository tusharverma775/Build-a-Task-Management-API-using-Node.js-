# Build-a-Task-Management-API-using-Node.js-

*Build a Task Management API using Node.js (Express.js) with a database (MongoDB or MySQL).*  

The API should allow users to:  

1) Register and log in (with JWT authentication).  
2) Create, update, delete, and retrieve tasks.  
3) Mark a task as *completed* or *pending*.  
4) Filter tasks by status (*completed/pending*).  
5) Pin a task.
